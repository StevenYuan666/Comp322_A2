# Object Oriented Doubly Linked List
Arrays have their limitations. Their size should be known in advance during compile time. Inserting a new element in an array is a costly operation because it involves the shifting of elements. Resizing an array is also a very costly operation because it involves the creation of a new array and the copying of all the elements to the new structure. These limitations can be avoided by using a Linked List data structure.

A linked list data structure is a collection of elements called nodes. Each element can hold data along with a pointer to the next element. Doubly linked list structures hold two pointers in each element instead of one. The first pointer points to the next element, and the second one points to the previous element in the list.
